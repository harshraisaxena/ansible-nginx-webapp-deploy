# Automated Web Application Deployment with Ansible

This project automates the deployment of a static web application on a remote server using Ansible. The playbook configures an Nginx web server, deploys the website files, and ensures the service is running correctly.

## üöÄ Project Overview

As a DevOps engineer, automating application deployment is a core task. This project uses Ansible to eliminate manual server setup. The Ansible playbook handles everything from installing Nginx to configuring the server and deploying the application code, making the process fast, repeatable, and error-free.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Tools

* **Ansible**: An automation tool used for configuration management and application deployment. It uses YAML playbooks to define tasks.
* **AWS EC2**: Two Ubuntu instances are used: one as the Ansible **controller node** (where Ansible commands are run) and one as the **target node** (where the website is deployed).
* **Nginx**: A high-performance web server used to host the static website.
* **Git & GitHub**: For version control of the Ansible project files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the website on your own AWS infrastructure:

### Prerequisites

1. An **AWS Account**  
2. Two Ubuntu EC2 instances (one controller, one target)  
3. An EC2 Key Pair for SSH access  
4. Ansible installed on the controller node  
5. Security Group configured to allow inbound traffic on **port 22 (SSH)** and **port 80 (HTTP)**

### üöÄ Quick Start: All Steps in One

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/harshraisaxena/ansible-nginx-webapp-deploy.git
cd ansible-nginx-webapp-deploy

# 2. Update the inventory file
# Edit the 'hosts' or 'inventory.ini' file with your target server's public IP and SSH key path
# Example:
# [webservers]
# 54.226.164.199 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your-key.pem

# 3. Run the Ansible playbook
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml

# 4. Verify the deployment
# Check Nginx status on the target node
systemctl status nginx

# Then open your browser and visit:
# http://54.226.164.199
